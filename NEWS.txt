Version 0.0.1
* This is a simple ANSI-C implementation of Triple-DES (as described in NIST Special Publication 800-67.)
* It illustrates the algorithm.
* It is platform independent.
* It can be compiled with gcc.
* The basic DES algorithm has been tested with MOVS (as described in NIST Special Publication 800-17.)
* The Triple-DES alogrithm has been tested with TMOVS (as described in NIST NIST Special Publication 800-20.)
